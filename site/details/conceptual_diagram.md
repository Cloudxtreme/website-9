# Conceptual Diagram

The following conceptual diagram relates Decaf and Ristretto.  More
details on its interpretation will be added in the future.

The
right-hand column, _groups & encodings_, connects the byte strings
produced by the encoding (middle, far right), to the quotient group
constructed by Ristretto (bottom, far right), via all intermediate
structures.  (In practice, the encoding formulas pass directly from
beginning to end; this is a conceptual diagram).

The center column, _curves & isogenies_, shows the relevant curves and
their relationships.

The left-hand column, _ristretto255 parameters_, shows the concrete
parameter choices used for `ristretto255`.
